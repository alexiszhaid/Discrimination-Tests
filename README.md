# Triangle Test – Sensory Evaluation in R

This repository contains a complete and reproducible R Markdown project that demonstrates the implementation and statistical analysis of the **Triangle Test**, a fundamental method in sensory evaluation. The project is part of a broader initiative to build a practical, code-focused book on sensory methods using R.

## 📘 About the Triangle Test

The triangle test is a **discriminative sensory method** used to determine whether a perceptible difference exists between two products. Each assessor receives three samples, two of which are identical. The task is to identify the odd one out. This method is widely used in food, beverage, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries to validate reformulations, quality control, and supplier changes.

This project includes:

- A brief explanation of the triangle test and its application.
- Simulated panelist data to illustrate the analysis.
- Statistical evaluation using:
  - Binomial test
  - Chi-squared test
  - Z-test for proportions
  - Exact methods via the `sensR` package
- Comparison of methods and interpretation of results
- Introduction to **similarity testing** and the role of **Type I and Type II errors**
- Use of the `discrim()` function from `sensR` for advanced modeling

  🧪 Part of a Book Project
This is one chapter of a modular, hands-on book on Sensory Evaluation using R, where each test method is explored through code and practical examples. The final compilation will include:

Discriminative tests (triangle, duo-trio, 2-AFC, tetrad, etc.)

Descriptive analysis (QDA, intensity scales)

Consumer tests (hedonic scaling, CATA)

Data visualization and statistical interpretation
